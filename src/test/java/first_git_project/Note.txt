*go to git-hub
    *Repositories>Create New Repository> first_git_project
3. Create a FIRST COMMIT for the First time
ONLY ONCE    *git init
EVERY TIME    *git add .
EVERY TIME    *git commit -m "first commit"
ONLY ONCE    *git branch -M main
ONLY ONCE    *git remote add origin https://github.com/abayramus/first_git_project.git
ONLY ONCE    *git push -u origin main
    *****Then your code should be pushed to git-hub. REFRESH YOUR PAGE TO SEE THE CODE
NOTE: git status    ->   This is our friend. This can be used anytime to see the progress
4. Create a new SECOND COMMIT
    *Create a new java class under first_git_package: MySecondClass
    *Create a new commit and push the code to git-hub
        * git add .
        * git commit -m "added my second java class"
        * git push
5. ADDING SPECIFIC FILES
    *Create 2 JAVA classes : MyThirdClass, MyFourthClass
    *Create a commit with ONLY myFourthClass
        *git add "src/first_git_package/MyFourthClass.java"
        *git commit -m "adding fourth class"
        *git push
6. GIT PULL
    *git pull is used to get the code from git-hub
    *git pull = git fetch + git merge
        NOTE: if git pull trows error then use:
        git fetch
        git merge
    * NOW THAT WE HAVE OUR LOCAL UPDATED, THEN COMMIT THE CODES AND PUSH ALL TOGETHER
        *git add .
        *git commit -m "committing my codes"
        *git push
NOTE: PULL BEFORE PUSH
        *git pull -> git add . -> git commit -m "message" -> git push

        ✦Create a new branch : git branch ahmet
        ✦ Check the branches: git branch -> you should see ahmet branch
        ✦Switch to the feature branch : git checkout ahmet
        ✦Now I’m on the feature branch. All changes I make will be only on this branch
        ✦Create a new class and write some code on this branch
        ✦MyLocalClass1
        ✦Create a new version on the branch
        ✦ git add .
        ✦ git commit -m “my local commit 1"
        ✦ git push --->>> NOTE : Gives error. First push must be done using below code
        ✦    git push --set-upstream origin ahmet
        ✦Check if your codes are in remote repository
        ✦Question 1: Does ahmet branch have the codes we just pushed? YESSSSSSS
        ✦Question 2: Does master have the codes we just pushed?  NOOOOO. WE HAVE TO MERGE ALL CODES TO MASTER.NEXT SLIDE
